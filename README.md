# PMM96
Professional measurement device organizer, used for e.g. ISO 9001 certification, visual dBase (1996).
This program has been created in 1996. It has been developed for about 5 years over few dBase versions. The last version has been written in Visual dBase. Don’t have licence anymore and it is not compatible to valid dBase versions. This code is uploaded to GitHub for anyone who is interested in. The program has been sold a few times to companies in machine construction. The program was thought as a data base for measurement devices or tools. It alarms if a calibration of a measurement tool has been expired. This is an integral part of an ISO 9001 certification of many companies. So it is a proper program which needs a code upgrade to live further. It is possible to read DBF files with free DBF viewers. The win help file can’t be read anymore under windows 10, since windows doesn’t support old hlp file format anymore (in win XP it was still possible).
